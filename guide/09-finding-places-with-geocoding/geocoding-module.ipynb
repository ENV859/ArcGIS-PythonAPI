    "In a GIS, geocoding is the process of transforming various place name descriptions into a location on the earth's surface. For successful geocoding operations there are necesary component technologies that must meet certain requirements before a place description can be properly located. The [ArcGIS Desktop Geocoding Documentation](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geocoding/what-is-geocoding.htm) explains the necessary components to successfully complete geocoding operations. It also outlines [Essential geocoding vocabulary](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geocoding/essential-geocoding-vocabulary.htm) to help you succeed in using the geocoding classes and functions in the ArcGIS API for Python geocoding module.\n",

    "#### Geocoding Module Types and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Your GIS provides access to [The World Geocoding Service](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/overview-world-geocoding-service.htm) by default. The geocoding module provides a `Geocoder` class to interact with that service. You can also construct `geocoder` objects from your GIS's custom geocoding service items or from the url to a [geocoding service](https://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/linux/geocode-services.htm). In addition, the `get_geocoders` function returns a list of `geocoders` accessible in your GIS. \n",
    "`Geocoders` have numerous properties accessed through `geocoder.properties`. These properties specify the types of information the `geocode` function accepts as input, and the structure of the outputs when performing geocoding operations using a particular geocoder. A `geocoder`'s properties also define any limits or requirements established by the underlying [locator](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geocoding/the-geocoding-workflow.htm). \n",
    "\n",
    "Place name descriptions can be located one at a time, or in a batch. The `geocode` function locates one description at a time (see [`findAddressCandidates`](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-find-address-candidates.htm) documentation for reference), while the `batch_geocode` function locates multiple descriptions (see [`geocodeAddresses`](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-geocode-addresses.htm) documentation for reference). The batch function [consumes credits](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-free-vs-paid.htm), so it's important to discern how you will perform geocoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `reverse_geocode` function outputs the address at a particular location on the earth. The `suggest` function returns matches for partial descriptions and underpins typeahead style suggestions in many client applications. The underlying service determines whether a `geocoder` supports this function. See the [Create Address Locator](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/geocoding/creating-an-address-locator.htm) help document for further details."
