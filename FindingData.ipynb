Let's look at each in the context of finding a particular dataset, namely [**USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset**](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/watershed-boundary-dataset-subregions-map). \n",

    "Searches return many different types of items. The various types are explained in depth [here](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/supported-items.htm), but some brief definitions of the more prevalent types are exlained below:\n",
    "* Maps\n",
    " * [Web Maps](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-web-map.htm) - Like an ArcPro map; includes one or many layers of data, each named and symbolized a specific way. \n",
    " \n",
    "* [Layers](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/layers.htm)\n",
    " * [Feature Layers](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/feature-layers.htm) - Like an ArcPro feature class; a single dataset that you can query, symbolize, and use in an analysis. \n",
    " * [Tile Layers](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/tile-layers.htm) - No analog in ArcPro; these are rasters served as images, but in chunks, or tiles, to minimize web traffic and speed delivery. They are good for display, but cannot be used in analysis. \n",
    " * [Map Image Layers](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/sharing/overview/map-image-layer.htm) - Like Tile Layers, these are images rendered from data. They are quick to display and often include multiple layers (of various types) that may have analytical capabilities like querying. \n",
    " * [Imagery Layers](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/sharing/overview/web-image-layer.htm) (AKA \"Web Imagery Layer\") - These are raster data and CAN be used in analysis. \n",
    " * [Scene Layers](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/scene-layers.htm) - These include multiple data layers, but the layers are optimized for 3d rendering. \n",
    " * Tables - Tables that you can query. \n",
    " * Layer Files - iles, stored as \"packages\", that you download to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Scenes](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-web-scene.htm) - Online interactive 3d maps comprised of various layers, basemaps, and ground elevation datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "→ **Apps**, **Tools**, & **Files** are less about data and more about capabilities of online GIS; we'll save that discussion for later. \n",
